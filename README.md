# Widespread genomic instability in an ancient nutritional endosymbiont of cicadas
by Piotr ≈Åukasik et al.

## Introduction
The ancient heritable nutritional endosymbiotic bacterium of cicadas, *Candidatus* Hodgkinia cicadicola (thereafter: *Hodgkinia*), has several unique characteristics relative to other bacteria. Strains from different cicada species have some of the smallest genomes and gene sets known, and are characterized some of the fastest rates of sequence evolution. Further, in many cicadas, the ancestral symbiont with tiny genomes has evolved ("split") into complexes of genetically and cytologically distinct lineages, whose genomes are particularly hard to assemble and annotate.  
  
Because of this, standard analysis and annotation tools perform poorly on Hodgkinia genomic data. Hence, we designed a set of custom tools for the data analysis, annotation, and visualization.  
  
The current repository contains scripts, reference datasets, and files that were used during the course of processing metagenomic and target enrichment datasets for over 200 cicada species, often hosting Hodgkinia at different levels of complexity.
